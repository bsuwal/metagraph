This is the first part of a series of short posts about life lessons I've learned from the wet and wild world of student theater.

I did theater for four years of high school, four years of college, and two summers at [Maine Teen Camp](teencamp.com).  I mostly did tech, but my presence graced the stage on a few occasions.  Some of the skills are pretty domain specific, like being able to change clothes in twenty seconds, but others are more broadly applicable.  This series of posts will be to share some of those more general and platitudinous lessons.

**Things will go wrong, and you should plan for that.**

*Murphy's Law* states that anything that can go wrong, will.  This applies equally to theater as to life.  If I'm running props, I should have some tape and paint handy because at some point, some actor will break something. Sometimes one of your Oompa Loompas forgets to show up, so you should be ready to paint a stagehand orange.  Sometimes, Brendan can't change his costume quickly enough so you have to ad-lib for a minute while wearing a wig, the ugliest floral blouse in the costume shop, and womens' chunky sandals (actually, that one was a lot of fun).

In life, people make mistakes, accidents happen, and things don't always go the way we expect.  Sometimes you can anticipate the issue and whip out your proverbial roll of tape from your back pocket.  Other times, you just have to go with the flow and let yourself be put into Oompa Loompa makeup five minutes before the show opens.  Or, take control of the situation.  Nobody plans on having to make up a short monologue to cover a costume change, but it's better than standing there in stony silence while the entire theater fills up with secondhand embarassment.
