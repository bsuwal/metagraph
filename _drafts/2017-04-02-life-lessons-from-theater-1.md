This is the first part of a series of short posts about life lessons I've learned from the wet and wild world of student theater.

As a grad student in an engineering school, I spend a lot of time in a cultural bubble which has a lot of scorn for the arts and humanities.  I want to show myself and others that there is value in the arts (and particularly arts education), even for engineers.

I'll start these posts with the motivating anecdote, which, luckily for you readers, will often involve yours truly in some sort of predicament or embarassing situation.

Imagine you are a sixteen year-old boy, a sophomore at a Catholic high school.  You are in the inaugural offering of Alicia Greenwood's Play Production course, performing in a shockingly good, if not a little frenetic, rendition of Woody Allen's *God*.  For those who don't know, *God* is a fast-paced, self-referential comedy with, like, thirty characters, although no more than five are ever on stage at a time.  The seven of us in the cast pulled off this masterful illusion by making rapid costume changes as we crossed behind the stage, exiting through one door as one character, and entering through the other seconds later as another.  The other missing detail here is that I went to an *all boys* high school, so three of us in the cast also ended up playing the few female characters in the show.

So Brendan and I are supposed to come on as Bob and Wendy Fate (respectively), two tourists who appear out of nowhere to give guidance to Diabetes, the play's hero/writer.  The hiccup occurs when Brendan, who is supposed to enter with an interjecting introduction, gets caught up in his costume change and isn't there to enter with me.  I can't just stand there and do nothing but watch the audience in this black box theater die of secondhand embarassment; I need to do *something*, and *quick*.

I clear my throat (buying precious seconds), clop over to the door wearing my cheap granny wig, terrible floral blouse, and chunky wedge sandals, and let loose with my best Jersey-nana-on-her-Florida-vacation ad-lib.  I'm stomping around, in character, yelling for Bob to get his sorry butt in there.  It worked (mostly).  I got a few laughs from the audience, I don't think anyone really noticed that we were moments away from theatrical disaster, and I stayed in character.  

The lesson: **Sometimes, things go wrong.  Just go with it.**
