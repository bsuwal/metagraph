# About Me 
{: style="color:#800000;" :}
I am a second-year PhD student in the [CIS Department](http://cis.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Aaron Roth](http://cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth). 

My research interests include game theory and mechanism design, learning theory, algorithmic fairness, and computational social science, which is to say I am interested in how strategic decision-making and social norms interact with algorithmic processes.

I also maintain an interest in [gerrymandering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering), the intentional drawing of district lines to favor some electoral outcome. I am primarily interested in the connections to mathematics and the computational sciences, but I try to stay aprised of the legal and sociopolitical aspects as well.

I am affiliated with the [CS Theory Reserach Group](http://theory.cis.upenn.edu/index.html), the [Warren Center for Network & Data Sciences](http://warrencenter.upenn.edu/), and the [Penn Research in Machine Learning (PRiML)](https://priml.upenn.edu/) group.

Before coming to Penn, I was an undergrad at [Colby College](http://colby.edu) in beautiful Waterville, Maine.  I was a [mathematics](colby.edu/math) and [economics](http://colby.edu/econ) double major with a [computer science](http://colby.edu/cs) minor.
