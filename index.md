# About Me 
{: style="color:#800000;" :}
I am a second-year PhD student in the [CIS Department](http://cis.upenn.edu) at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Aaron Roth](http://cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth).  My research interests are game theory, mechanism design, machine learning, computing in the social sciences, and how those areas interact and intersect. 




Before coming to Penn, I was an undergrad at [Colby College](http://colby.edu) in beautiful Waterville, Maine.  I was a [mathematics](colby.edu/math) and [economics](http://colby.edu/econ) double major with a [computer science](http://colby.edu/cs) minor.  I was heavily involved with [Powder and Wig](http://web.colby.edu/powderandwig), the student-run theater group, as well as a perennial math/cs/econ TA and tutor.
