  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’d like to apologize if this post comes across as self-aggrandizing, but this is one of my proudest (and only) accomplishments, and I learned a lot from the process.</p>

<p>I want to share the story of the time that I masterminded a benevolent dictatorship of Powder and Wig, the student-run theater club at Colby College.  In the grand scheme of things, a club at a tiny school in Maine is small potatoes, but Powder and Wig was a really important part of my and many others’ <strong>Colby Experience™</strong>. One of the downsides to living in such an isolated environment is that the small potatoes look like big potatoes.</p>

<p>Powder and Wig is run by an executive board.  For my first two years at Colby, the board was essentially run by one individual, with the rest of the board doing their jobs as asked.  This person was incredibly dedicated and passionate, but he ran the club in such a way that when he graduated, the remaining members of the board, who all carried over into the next year, had very little idea of what actually needed to be done to keep the club moving.  Add onto that the personal beef between the president and vice president as well as that they had competing visions regarding the purpose of student theater (the president felt that the club should be about promoting inclusiveness and fun while the vice president asserted that the goal of the club should be to produce the highest quality shows possible), and the club was in a poor spot by the end of my junior year.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>If you want to get something done, you have to do it yourself.</em>
At the end of my junior year, I was frustrated with how the club was being run. The Powder and Wig vice president is primarily responsible for high-level production logistics, and having experience in play production, I decided that was the job I wanted.  I went around and asked seven other people to run for the board to fill the seats, quietly orchestrating the takeover.  Nearly every race was uncontested (notwithstanding some wriein votes for various sandwiches).  Had I not rounded up a board, there wouldn’t have been a board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>You can’t accomplish anything alone.</em>
I am forever grateful to Katherine, Cait, Claire, Christine, Lily, Chelsea, and Nora for all of their hard work turing the club around.  They were there to help implement the good ideas and to tell me when my ideas were stupid.  We agreed as a group that the leadership of the club needed to have a culture of responsibility and unity; disagreements didn’t leave the room.  Nothing tears a club apart faster than the members sensing or observing factionalism in the leadership. Together, we produced a season of theater which was high quality, high participation, and well-attended; an undisputable success.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Pick your battles.</em>
Sometimes, things happen that you don’t like.  Sometimes, you have the power to change it.  Sometimes you should.  Sometimes you shouldn’t.  We as a group certainly agreed on our overall vision for having a successful club, but at the level of implementation, we had conflicting thoughts.  Sometimes, the details are important and worth arguing into the night.  Other times, you just have to state your opinion and move on if everyone else disagrees.  If you try to fight every issue, you waste both your energy and your credibility.  The person in the meetings who fights every issue is eventually dismissed as a contrarian and in a boy-who-cries-wolf way, loses the ability to actually affect change on an issue that is truly important.  It was really important to me that we set up fair grievance procedures for members with problems, but I wasn’t going to nitpick at the planning details for the club’s Movie Night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>It’s important, but difficult, to separate personal and professional relationships.</em>
My fellow board members were (they still are) some of my best friends. One of them was even my roommate.  As such, it is very challenging to separate the personal from the professional.  How do I disagree with someone without risking the friendship?  How do I agree with someone without it looking like we are ganging up on the rest of the group?  This separation was something I learned to do early on.  I think others struggled with it more than I did, but I think we as a group succeeded with it 90% of the time.  Being able to do this allowed us to make big, difficult decisions like discussing a vote to eliminate one of the board positions while the person holding that seat was in the room.</p>
