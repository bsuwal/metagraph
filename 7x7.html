  <main>
    <p>
      Once more Gridlandia has gotten a little bigger, and now our task is to examine drawing seven
      connected,
      equal-size districts (we're going to skip the 6x6 grid because we don't want to have to worry
      about ties). We'd
      like to be able to do a similar analysis as in the 5x5 case, where we can examine a proposed
      plan and a
      distribution of voters to see if there is evidence that the plan was intentionally selected
      to favor or disfavor
      one of the parties. This time, however, we don't have a full list of all of the legal plans.
      We know that
      <a href="http://oeis.org/A172477">there are 158,753,814 of them</a>, and even with a careful
      encoding scheme, a
      file containing all of these would be a couple of gigabytes. But this is okay! If we have
      trouble writing down
      all of the legal districtings of a 7x7 grid, there is no way we'll be able to do such a thing
      for a real
      jurisdiction, so we can use this as an opportunity to develop some <strong>sampling
        techniques</strong>.</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we generate a random, and hopefully representative, sample of plans?
      There are two really simple techniques which are terrible on their
      own, but when combined become very powerful. The first is to have a computer generate
      district assignments of the
      cells by a uniformly random process
      and keep the ones which satisfy the criteria for being legal districting plans. What's great
      about this is
      that each valid plan occurs with equal probability. What's not so great is that this
      probability is extremely
      tiny. While there are a very large number of legal plans, there are way, way, way more
      labellings than legal
      plans&mdash;about $10^{33}$ of them. Even if we had a computer that could generate 1,000
      attempted plans per
      second, we wouldn't expect to hit a valid one within a human lifetime, or the duration of
      life on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second strategy is to use a human to produce plans. This has the advantage of not wasting
      time drawing and
      checking labellings which are not legal plans. The downside is that, in the grand scheme of
      things, humans are
      pretty slow at this task. Some of our brave researchers tried to write down all of the legal
      plans for the 4x4
      grid and, although they succeeded, it did take quite a few hours of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we combine these? What we can do is <strong>start with a human-drawn (or
        human-assisted) plan</strong>,
      then use a computer to <strong>randomly modify it</strong>. Remember when we defined two
      plans to be <strong>adjacent
        in the metagraph</strong> if we could transform one into the other by swapping two cells in
      adjacent districts?
      Since there are only 1176 ways to randomly pick a pair of cells to try to swap in a 7x7 grid,
      a computer can very easily move from one plan to the next, which is exactly what is
      happening in the animation below. Every half-second, an algorithm randomly picks two cells
      and checks if
      exchanging their district assignments yields a legal districting plan. If so, it moves to
      that plan. If not, it
      tries again.
    </p>

    <div id="randomwalk" class="chart"></div>

    <p>
      We are doing a <strong>random walk</strong> on the metagraph. Each plan is represented by a
      node in the
      metagraph. Every second, the walk takes a random step to one of the neighbors of the current
      plan. This algorithm
      is remarkable for three important reasons. The first is its simplicity&mdash;the demo above
      is running live off
      of
      about 50 lines of JavaScript, in your browser, right now. The second is the effectiveness and
      speed. While it
      would take a long time to enumerate <em>all</em> of the legal districting plans, we can
      definitely
      enumerate a huge chunk of them very quickly. The third is that the process often rapidly
      converges to a truly
      representative sample of the full universe.
    </p>
    <h3>Introducing MCMC: A Demo</h3>
    <p>
      This kind of sampling algorithm is called a <em><strong>Markov chain Monte Carlo</strong></em>
      method, or MCMC
      for short. These are incredibly powerful tools for sampling, approximation, and optimization
      in settings where it
      is difficult to get your hands on the object you're interested in, such as the space of all
      valid districting
      plans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once again, you can select a distribution of voters below. This time you can design a plan by
      clicking and
      right-clicking the cells to change their district assignment, or press the 'Random Plan'
      button to have the
      random walk choose one for you. Once you have a valid plan, press the 'MCMC Sampler' button
      to generate a
      histogram. The <span class="blue">Blue</span> bar represents the number of seats your
      distribution of voters the
      <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins under your selected plan, and the histogram
      bars show
      the seat shares for a sample of 1,000 plans generated by the MCMC random walk. If the <span
        class="blue">Blue</span>
      bar is to the left of most of the mass of the histogram, it means that the nearby sample
      found a lot of plans
      that gave more seats to the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party than yours. If the <span
        class="blue">Blue</span>
      bar is to the right of most of the mass, it means that the sampler found a lot of plans which
      give more seats to
      the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party than yours.
    </p>

    <div id="gridspace" class="chart rows">
      <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: row; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
        <div class="grid-container" style="margin: 0 2rem">
          <h4>Design a distribution $\Delta$</h4>
          <div id="current-delta" class="grid"></div>
          <button id="random-delta">Randomize $\Delta$</button>
          <p>Click cells to toggle</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-container" style="margin: 0 2rem">
          <h4>Design a plan $\mathcal D$</h4>
          <div id="current-d" class="grid"></div>
          <button id="random-d">Randomize $\mathcal D$</button>
          <p>Click cells change their district assignments</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h4>Is your plan an outlier for this distribution?</h4>
      <button id="go-button">Sample with MCMC</button>
      <div id="histogram"></div>
      <p>Number of <span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> seats</p>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you leave your distribution of voters alone and click the Sample button multiple times,
      the histogram will
      change, but not by too much, and the general shape will still be the same. This is because
      even though 1,000 is a
      very small number compared to 158,753,814&mdash;less than one percent of one
      percent&mdash;it's still a large
      enough sample of
      plans to be a fairly <strong>representative</strong> of the whole collection of plans. How to
      do this in the real
      world where we need to draw districts on states and municipalities which may have hundreds or
      thousands of cells
      is a hot area of research in redistricting.
    </p>

    <!-- <h3>Exploration with MCMC: Finding extremes</h3>

    <p>
      As another indication of how well our random walks are exploring, let's see what happens if we take many short
      runs
      and look for extreme outcomes. Once you pick your distribution and click to search, the algorithm will run
      for 1,500 steps in short bursts of 150. Every 150 steps, it restarts its walk from the most extreme plan
      it has found so far, and at the end it displays the best one found overall.
    </p>

    <div id="optspace" class="chart center"></div>

    <p>
      The idea behind this is that plans which disproportionately favor one particular party tend to be near each other
      in the metagraph, so we should search for improvements near the best plan we've already seen. However, we don't
      want to get stuck in a neighborhood which has pretty good plans, but not the best, so we introduce some
      randomness
      to get us unstuck, in a way that is controlled by the restart frequency.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll notice that this does really well, but not always perfectly. For example, if you make the top three rows
      all <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> and the bottom four all <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>,
      if you try a few times, the algorithm will probably find a plan that lets the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
      Party win six seats, but almost certainly not one with seven <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
      districts. This is for two reasons -- first, that there is only one plan which has seven <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring
      districts (seven vertical strips), and the second is that this plan has very low degree in the metagraph, so it's
      hard for the random walk to find it. It's remarkable that it can even find a plan with six <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring
      districts. If you plug that distribution into the sampling tool above and look at the histograms, you'll see that
      the vast majority of plans have four <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats, with a small handful
      of plans with five. Very rarely will it even find a six-<span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-seat plan,
      which demonstrates the effectiveness of the restarting mechanism.
    </p>-->
    <p>
      Sampling real-world districting plans is of course much more complex than sampling on the
      grid, but fundamentally
      the idea of the random walk is the same. When you change the details of how you conduct the
      random walk,
      you change the "stationary distribution"&mdash;in other words, it alters the weight that
      tells you how likely
      each plan is to come up if you were were to walk for a very long time.
      The scientific community is currently spending lots of energy to understand the
      details of how to conduct these walks to come to the strongest conclusions
      about the universe of redistricting possibilities.
