    <h1>Redistricting a 5x5 Grid</h1>

  <main>
    <p>
      Now let's consider how to redistrict a 5x5 grid into 5 rook-contiguous districts of 5 units each.
      (Gridlandia has grown!) 
      There
      are 4006 districting plans which satisfy these criteria, and we can construct the metagraph in the same way as
      <a href="./4x4.html">before</a>&mdash;with
      a node for each plan and an edge between plans that can be transformed into each other by one step (swapping two cells in
      adjacent districts). We can write these all down, but the full visualization is hard to work with.
      Instead, we'll show a local picture of the metagraph where you can see a districting plan and all of the other
      plans within two steps.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Click on a plan in the local metagraph to recenter at its neighborhood. Alternatively, use the panel on the
      left to build a districting plan from scratch and jump directly to it. 
      Click the units on the left to toggle the vote between the two parties and see the winning side change in the 
      metagraph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since there are 4006 possible districting plans, it's hard to get a good sense of whether the distribution of
      votes allows for a lot of <span class="orange">Orange</span>-favoring plans or <span class="purple">Purple</span>-favoring
      plans. A local neighborhood of the metagraph may consist entirely of plans which give the <span class="purple">Purple</span>
      Party the majority of seats, even though most other plans actually favor the <span class="orange">Orange</span>
      Party.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of trying to draw the whole metagraph, we can compute some <strong>statistics</strong> about all of the
      plans with respect to the distribution of votes and also for the distribution of votes with respect to all of the
      plans. Here, you can build a plan using the panel on the left, or click to navigate through the metagraph in the
      previous section. The current plan will be displayed next to the navigator panel. Next to that, you can click the
      square to change the distribution of the voters, just as before. Finally, there are two histograms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first histogram shows how many distributions of voters with the same number of <span class="orange">Orange</span>
      and <span class="purple">Purple</span> squares as the distribution you picked result in a certain
      number
      of seats for the <span class="purple">Purple</span> Party in your selected plan. The number of
      <span class="purple">Purple</span> seats in your selected distribution is indicated by the <span class="green">Green</span>
      bar.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second histogram shows how many <span class="purple">Purple</span> seats your distribution
      gives over all 4006 possible districting plans. The number of <span class="purple">Purple</span> seats
      in your selected plan is indicated by the <span class="blue">Blue</span> bar.
    </p>

    <div id="chart2" class="chart three-columns"></div>

    <p>
      How should we interpret this?
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's start with the first histogram. This histogram shows the number of distributions which award the <span
        class="purple">Purple</span>
      Party a certain number of seats in your plan. We can use this to compare the outcome under your distribution to
      all of the other outcomes. If the <span class="blue">Blue</span> bar is to the left of most of the
      mass in the histogram, it means that your arrangement of voters has fewer <span class="purple">Purple</span>
      seats than if we had chosen a random arrangement of the same voters for the same districting plan. Conversely, if
      the <span class="blue">Blue</span> bar is to the right of most of the mass in the histogram, then
      your arrangement of voters awards <em>more</em> seats than average to the <span class="purple">Purple</span>
      Party, fixing your districting plan. These may suggest that your plan was carefully selected to favor one of the
      parties.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second histogram tells the same story, but in reverse. If the <span class="green">Green</span>
      bar is to the left of most of the mass of the histogram, it means that, fixing your <strong>arrangement of voters</strong>,
      among
      all possible ways to draw the districts, your plan gives fewer than the average number of seats to the <span
        class="purple">Purple</span> Party, and if the <span class="green">Green</span> bar is to
      the right of most of the mass in the histogram, then your plan has <strong>more</strong> <span class="purple">Purple</span>
      seats than the average plan. This histogram shows how difficult it is to find plans which favor a particular
      party. If you try putting ten <span class="purple">Purple</span>
      voters on the grid in a very spread out way, there are very few plans in which the <span class="purple">Purple</span>
      Party wins three seats. If you cluster them closer together, then there are far more ways to draw plans which
      give three seats to the <span class="purple">Purple</span> Party.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, we'll look at the 7x7 grid, which has too many valid districting plans for us to actually write down, so
      we'll have to develop some more sophisticated methods to do these kinds of statistical comparisons.
