      This project uses interactive widgets and visualizations to explore some of the mathematical tools used to
      analyze the legislative redistricting process, particularly the detection of gerrymandering. We use the toy
      examples of grd4, 5x5, and 7x7 grids to develop and demonstrate these techniques. We present the
      construction of the <em>metagraph</em> on the 4x4 grid, the <em>statistical techniques</em> to determine
      whether a plan is an electoral outlier on the 5x5 grid, and <em>Markov chain Monte Carlo</em> methods for
      sampling on the 7x7 grid.

  <main>
    <p>
      Gridlandia is trying to draw legislative districts for its upcoming elections. The rules are that there must be
      four districts, they must be contiguous, and they must all be of the same size. Since Gridlandia is laid out
      neatly
      in a four-by-four grid, it's not too hard to write all of the allowed districting plans down. There are only
      117 of
      them.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Here is one:</figcaption>

    </figure>

    <p>
      We can impose a <em>graph</em> structure on the collection of all of these plans, where each node is a plan and
      two
      plans
      are connected if one can be transformed into the other by swapping a pair of cells in adjacent districts.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <div>
        <img src="imgs/fillgrid.png?raw=true">
        <img src="imgs/showswapgrid.png?raw=true">

      <figcaption>
        We can transfom the plan on the left into the plan on the right by swapping these two cells.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We call this structure the <strong>metagraph of districting plans</strong>. Below, you can interact with this
      mathematical object. The graph on the left is the complete metagraph. Since Gridlandia is so symmetric, it
      might
      be useful to consider two districting plans to be <em>the same</em> if one can be transformed into the other by
      rotating or
      flipping the plan. For example,
    </p>

    <figure>
      <div>
        <img src="imgs/fillgrid.png?raw=true">
        <img src="imgs/rotgrid.png?raw=true">
      </div>
      <figcaption>
        We can transfom the plan on the left into the plan on the right by rotating 90 degrees.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      The graph on the right is the metagraph where plans which are symmetric are merged into the same node, and two
      nodes are linked if any two of their two constituent nodes are linked in the full metagraph. Mouse over a node in
      the graph on the left to see the corresponding plan and highlight all of the other nodes corresponding to
      symmetric
      plans. Click a node to highlight all of its neighbors. Clicking a node in the graph on the right will highlight
      all
      nodes in that symmetry class in the graph on the left as well as all of the neighbors of all of those plans.</p>

    <div id="chart1" style="width:100%; text-align:left"></div>

    <p>
      Now let's think about elections in Gridlandia. Gridlandia has plurality elections and two political parties, the
      <strong style="color:#857ab8">Purple</strong> Party and the <strong style="color:#fca336">Orange</strong>
      Party. For simplicity, we'll start by assuming that everyone in the same cell votes the same way -- either for
      the
      <strong style="color:#857ab8">Purple</strong> candidate or the <strong style="color:#fca336">Orange</strong>
      candidate. Within each district, the candidate which gets the most votes wins the election, and ties are not
      resolved. Below, click a cell once to change its color. On the left, the nodes in the metagraph will change color
      to indicate which party wins a legislative majority under the corresponding plan. A node will remain grey if the
      number of <strong style="color:#857ab8">Purple</strong>- and <strong style="color:#fca336">Orange</strong>-favoring
      districts is equal.</p>

    <div id="chart2" style="width:100%; text-align:left"></div>

    <p>
      Let's make things a little more realistic. Instead of each cell voting entirely for one party, there are some
      <strong style="color:#857ab8"> Purple </strong> and some <strong style="color:#fca336"> Orange </strong>
      supporters in each cell -- a total of ten in each square. The same electoral rules apply, but now we can think
      about a <em>distribution</em> of votes in each cell. Left click on a square to increase the percentage of <strong
        style="color:#fca336">
        Orange </strong>
      voters, or right click it to decrease the percentage of <strong style="color:#fca336">Orange</strong> voters.</p>

    <p>
      What happens when the <strong style="color:#fca336">Orange</strong> party has a slight majority in most of the
      cells but a few are 90 or 100 percent <strong style="color:#857ab8">Purple</strong>? Under which configurations
      can the minority party still win three out of four districts? Are there any distributions of voters that cause
      there to be a <strong style="color:#857ab8">Purple</strong> colored metagraph node surrounded entirely by <strong
        style="color:#fca336"> Orange </strong> colored nodes?</p>

    <div id="chart3" style="width:100%; text-align:left"></div>

    <p>
      If we're interested in studying redistricting in the real-world, we'll need techniques which work on cases which
      are more complex than a 4x4 grid. We will develop some of these techniques using the 5x5 grid, which has a much
      larger set of valid districting plans.
