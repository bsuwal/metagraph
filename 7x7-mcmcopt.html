        <h3><em>Random samples</em> versus <em>demonstration plans</em></h3>
        <p>
          Up until now, we've focused on understanding a "normal range" for the parties among samples of 
          districting plans that are drawn in a neutral way &mdash; by an MCMC random walk. 
          Here, we wil shift the focus to instead find plans to <em> demonstrate what is possible </em>
          rather than <em> what is normal</em> For instance, we might want to know the largest number of 
          districts that can be drawn competitively in a plan without sacrificing other rules. 
          Or if we are checking compliance with the Voting Rights Act, we might want to know how many 
          districts can be simultaneously drawn with a certain group in the majority. We'll consider how to 
          make demonstration plans of different kinds on the 7x7 grid.
        </p>


        <h3>Finding extremes</h3>
        <p>
          The first thing we'll do is use the MCMC <a href="https://mggg.org/metagraph/7x7.html"> sampler we built in the last demo </a>, 
          but instead of using it
          to generate an ensemble of plans to compare against, we'll use it to hunt for plans which award a high
          number of seats to one of the parties.  We've slightly modified the code to look for extreme outcomes. 
          Once you pick your distribution and click to search, the algorithm will run
          for 1,500 steps in short bursts of 150. Every 150 steps, it restarts its walk from the most extreme plan
          it has found so far, and at the end it displays the best one found overall.
        </p>

        <div id="optspace" class="chart center"></div>

        <p>
          The idea behind this is that plans which disproportionately favor one particular party tend to be near each other
          in the metagraph, so we should search for improvements near the best plan we've already seen. However, we don't
          want to get stuck in a neighborhood which has pretty good plans, but not the best, so we introduce some
          randomness
          to get us unstuck, in a way that is moderated by the restart frequency.  
        </p>

        <p>
          You'll notice that this does really well, but not always perfectly. For example, if you make the top three rows
          all <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> and the bottom four all <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>,
          if you try a few times, the algorithm will probably find a plan that lets the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
          Party win six seats, but almost certainly not one with seven <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
          districts. This is for two reasons &mdash; first, that there is only one plan which has seven <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring
          districts (seven vertical strips), and the second is that this plan has very low degree in the metagraph, so it's
          hard for the random walk to find it. It's remarkable that it can even find a plan with six <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring
          districts. If you plug that distribution into the sampling tool on the <a href="https://mggg.org/metagraph/7x7.html"> previous page </a> 
          and look at the histograms, you'll see that
          the vast majority of plans have four <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats, with a small handful
          of plans with five. Very rarely will it even find a six-<span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-seat plan,
          which demonstrates the effectiveness of the restarting mechanism.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is using the same MCMC algorithm as before, it just remembers the most extreme plan it's seen so far.  
          If we step back for a second, this is a pretty ineffective way of constructing a gerrymander.  If someone 
          decides to pick an unfair map by clicking the MCMC button which generates the most extreme map possible, then 
          it will be very easy for us to use the same MCMC algorithm to show that the plan is an extreme outlier.
          
        </p>



        <h3>Elections aren't a sure thing</h3>
        <p>
          Of course in real life, gerrymanders are harder to detect than this because of the uncertainty in elections.  
          If there is some randomness in the outcomes and the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins six of the 
          seven seats, is that because the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party is structurally disadvantaged by the 
          districting plan or were they just unlucky this time? We'll incorporate this into our model and show how we 
          can still use the MCMC sampler to help us answer this question.
        </p>


        <h3>Electoral uncertainty</h3> 
        <p>
         Before we move forward, we need an additional piece of machinery from probability theory.  Up until now, we've
         treated elections as <em>deterministic</em>, meaning that a party will surely win a seat if at least half of the
         squares in the corresponding district are of that color.  Now, we'll introduce a little bit of uncertainty.  To 
         keep the math simple, we'll now say that the <em>probability</em> that a party wins a seat depends on the 
         <em>number of squares in the coresponding district of that color</em>.  We'll use the following rule to decide 
         the probability that the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins a seat:
       </p>
        <table>
        <tbody>
        <tr text-align="center">
        <td align="center">Number of <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Squares</td>
        <td align="center">Chance the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party Wins</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">0 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span></td>
        <td align="center">Never</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">1 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span></td>
        <td align="center">Never</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">2 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span></td>
        <td align="center">10%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">3 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span></td>
        <td align="center">33%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">4 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span></td>
        <td align="center">66%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">5 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span></td>
        <td align="center">90%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">6 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span></td>
        <td align="center">Always</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">7 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span></td>
        <td align="center">Always</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
      <p>
        The rule is the same for the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party.
       </p>

       <p>
         Now, instead of talking about how many seats a particular party wins, 
         we need to talk about how many <em>and</em> with what probability.  Below, you can adjust the arrangement
         of the voters to play around with this concept.  The districting plan is fixed, and as you change the 
         voters, you'll see the probability that the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins each district 
         as well as <em>total probabilities</em> for the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party winning 
         any particular number of seats.  Since we only have two parties, this also tells us the same information 
         for the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party's prospects, since, for example, the probability that the 
         <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins three seats is exactly the same as the probability that the 
         <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party wins four seats.  
       </p>

        <div id="histogram"></div>
        <p>Probability of <em>exactly</em> $k$ <span class="hearts">&hearts;</span> seats</p>
      </div>

      <p>
       When examining a districting plan, these probabilities are extremely important. 
       Notice that if you make each district have four <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters and 
       three <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> voters, then there is still a small probability of 
       the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party winning a majority of seats,
       but if you have four districts with seven  <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters,  and 
       three with seven <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> voters, then the
       <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party can never win a majority of the seats.
     </p>


     <p>
      This next demo is the enahnced version of the first one on this page.  Since elections are random things 
      now, we can't just look at the plans which have the "most" <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> or 
      <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> seats.  Instead, we need to talk about the <em> probability distribution 
      induced by a districting plan</em> over all the outcomes.  Below, you can adjust the arrangement of the voters 
      as before and click the buttons with the numbers.  Picking a number $k$ finds the plan which <em> maximizes the 
        probability of <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> winning at least $k$ districts</em>.
     </p>



<!--      <p>
       Now, thinking like a gerrymanderer, the key problem to consider is <em>supposing we want at 
      least a certain number of the districts to be 
      won by the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party with a certain probability, how should we
      draw the districts?</em> We've introduced a new degree of freedom, called <em>seat fragility</em> which 
      quantifies how secure the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party feels about the outcome.  Using the example above, 
      we might feel better about drawing a plan where the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party is guaranteed to win
      four of the seven seats than one which leaves the door open for our rivals to win a majority, even if it does allow 
      the possibility of winning a larger majority sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantity we're interested in examining is the <em>cumulative probability</em> of the 
      <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party winning <em>at least</em> some number of seats $k$. 
      In other words, we can take any districting plan and arrangement of voters and figure out 
      the probability of there being at least $k$ <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins in 
      our new randomized model.  As we just saw, the plan which maximizes this quantity is different for 
      different choices of $k$.  The safe plan, where four districts have all <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> 
      voters and three have all <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> voters is the best choice if we choose $k$ to be 
      four, but it's definitely not the right one if we want $k$ to be five.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This all seems well and good, but even once we pick $k$, we've made the problem of finding the best plan 
      much harder, at least by hand.  Before, we could kind of rely on a packing-and-cracking heurstic where we 
      try to make the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party win their districts by a bigger margin than the 
      <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins theirs, but that doesn't seem like quite enough when 
      we're working in this richer probabilistic model.  Fortunately for us, the MCMC algorithm from 
      before is well-equipped to perform this search.

    <p>
      Again, this does pretty well, though not always perfectly.  One reason for this is that ten rounds of 
      150 steps is not all that many samples, compared to the total universe of plans. Additionally, instead 
      of simply winning a district by having the majority of its voters be <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>, 
      we care about <em>how many</em> <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters are in each district.  To put it 
      more concretely, in the old model, there was no difference between having a $\frac{4}{7}$ <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> 
      and a $\frac{6}{7}$ <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> district and two $\frac{5}{7}$ <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> 
      districts, but now we care about this distinction.  We've gone from eight possible outcomes, <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> 
      winning zero to seven districts, to over 3,000, the number of possible probability distributions over these randomized 
      outcomes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll also notice that, in general, as you pick larger numbers, the histogram spreads out more.  This is because, as long 
      as there isn't an overwhelming majority of <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters, a plan which gives <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> 
       a shot at six or seven seats 
      needs to have the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters spread out across many districts, whereas plans which only need to secure 
      one or two seats can safely pack many <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters into a few districts.  The natural context in which to 
      analyze this tradeoff is to look at the <em>competitiveness</em> and <em>representativeness</em> of plans.  
    </p>

<h3> Demonstrating Representativeness and Competitiveness</h3>

<p> 
  We first need to articulate definitions of these concepts before analyzing any plans.  The <em>representativeness</em> 
  of a plan measures how close the final division of seats matches the proportions of <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> 
  and <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> voters in the population.  A plan in which the voters are approximately 
  half <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> and half <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> but very rarely awards more than two 
  <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats is far from representative, whereas a plan which almost always has either three or four 
  <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats is highly representative.  In terms of the histograms, from the previous two demos, 
  we can think of representativeness as how tightly the bars are clustered around the value of $k$ which is closest to the 
  true fraction of <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Competitiveness</em> is a little more subtle.  First, we'll call a district "competitive" if it's close to having an equal 
  chance of being won by <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> or <span class="clubs">Clubs</span>. Formally, we'll measure it by the difference between $50\%$ and the percent chance that the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins it (remember, since the probabilities are symmetric we could just as well choose to measure against the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party's chances). 
  In 7x7 Gridlandia, the competitive districts are the ones which have three voters from one party and four from the other. We can then measure the <em>competitiveness</em> 
  of a plan by taking the total over all of the districts. A perfectly competitive plan (which doesn't exist here, because of odd numbers) gets a score of zero.  With respect to the histograms, competitveness describes how spread out 
  the bars are.  A more competitive plan allows for a wider variety of outcomes, so the histogram bars will be spread out more, and 
  a less competitive plan will have a narrow, spiked histogram.

</p>
<p>
  This should immediately raise an alarm. <em>Representativeness</em> and <em>competitiveness</em> both sound like good things, 
  but they also sound like they're incompatible with each other.  If there are 14 <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters all 
  in two districts and 35 <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> voters all in the remaining five, then the outcome of the election 
  will always be perfectly representative and extremely non-competitive.  Using the same numbers of voters, we could draw 
  every district with two <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters, resulting in a plan which is a little more competitive, 
  but much less representative.  But, this is all in the abstract, as whether such a plan even can be drawn depends on where the 
  <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters are actually located in Gridlandia.  If they aren't arranged in a suitable way, 
  either of these kind of plans might be impossible to find.  
  Given an arrangement of voters, we might be interested in what the most competitive or representative 
  plan is, and using MCMC to find demonstration plans is a great way to find such things.
</p>


<p>
  In the next demo, you can once again choose the arrangement of voters and use the buttons to have the 
  MCMC algorithm search for the most representative or competitive plan it can find.

  Try keeping the number of  <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> and  <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters

  matching the relative proportions of voters in the   population?  How randomly 
  intersperse do they have to be before the most competitive and most representative 
  plans are basically the same?  Certainly in theory this could happen if it's impossible to find  
  a districting plan that doens't have three  <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> and four  <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> 
  voters in every district, but for which arrangements of voters does this theoretical plan actually exist?
</p>
<p>
  Finding a demonstration plan which shows that, for example, there exists a set of districts which offers proportional representation 
  for the  <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party relates very strongly to how gerrymandering is challenged  
  in real life.  If some group comes forward alleging that it is systematically disenfranchised by the enacted districting plan, 
  being able to use a demonstration plan which shows that there is some viable alternative which does not disadvantage them is 
  very compelling evidence both in courts of law and in the court of public opinion.  Since the universe of districting plans 
  for the 7x7 grid, let alone a proper juridiction, is far too large to search exhaustively, we can use MCMC to guide our 
  metagraph exploration.

  Over the last two chapters, we've introduced two facets of MCMC for redistricting which, even in the simple example 
  of small grids, are incredibly powerful tools for the analysis of gerrymandering.  <a href="https://mggg.org/metagraph/7x7.html">Previously,</a> we looked at using MCMC for outlier analysis, where we let the MCMC algorithm generate a big sample of plans, called an <em>ensemble</em>, and then compared our plan of interest to the outcomes across the ensemble.  This provides us with <em>statistical evidence</em>, 
  since we can detect if a plan yields outcomes which are too extreme relative to the ensemble.  Here, we've used MCMC to 
  <em>search a plan meeting some criterion</em>, such as maximal representativeness or competitiveness.  But, we can notice that these two things aren't very different, we've just used a different method for crawling around on the metagraph.  Before, when we were looking for a random 
  sample, we walked around randomly.  Here, since we're looking for something in particular, we modify the MCMC process to more directly 
  move toward what want.  There are of course many other ways we could walk around the metagraph.  The scientific community, including MGGG, are thinking hard about these different ways of walking around the metagraph both in theory and in practice.  Since the metagraph for a real jurisdiction is so complex, it's useful to have more basic testbeds, like the 7x7 grid, to experiment with these concepts.
