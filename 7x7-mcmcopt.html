<!--   	<h3>So you want to do a gerrymander?</h3>
  	<p>
  		Up until now, we've developed mathematical tools to try to <em>detect</em> and <em>analyze</em> potential gerrymandering,
  		but now we're going to take the opposite point of view and look at how to apply this knowlege to <em>creating</em> a
  		gerrymander. When we develop algorithmic tools which interface with society, it's important to consider the 
  	    full scope of how those tools will be used, and by examining the mathematics from this perspective,
  	    we can gain greater insight into how we might be able to detect and analyze gerrymandering.   We'll continue 
  	    working on the 7x7 grid.
  	</p>

  	<p>
  		Today, we've been tapped as expert gerrymanderers for the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party.  They
  		want us to help them find districting plans which have a large number of 
  		<span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring districts.  
  	</p>
 -->

    <h3>Finding extremes</h3>
    <p>
      The first thing we'll do is use the MCMC sampler we built in the last demo, but instead of using it
      to generate an ensemble of plans to compare against, we'll use it to hunt for plans which award a high
      number of seats for one of the parties.  We've slightly modified the code to look for extreme outcomes. 
      Once you pick your distribution and click to search, the algorithm will run
      for 1,500 steps in short bursts of 150. Every 150 steps, it restarts its walk from the most extreme plan
      it has found so far, and at the end it displays the best one found overall.
    </p>

    <div id="optspace" class="chart center"></div>

    <p>
      The idea behind this is that plans which disproportionately favor one particular party tend to be near each other
      in the metagraph, so we should search for improvements near the best plan we've already seen. However, we don't
      want to get stuck in a neighborhood which has pretty good plans, but not the best, so we introduce some
      randomness
      to get us unstuck, in a way that is moderated by the restart frequency.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll notice that this does really well, but not always perfectly. For example, if you make the top three rows
      all <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> and the bottom four all <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>,
      if you try a few times, the algorithm will probably find a plan that lets the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
      Party win six seats, but almost certainly not one with seven <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
      districts. This is for two reasons -- first, that there is only one plan which has seven <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring
      districts (seven vertical strips), and the second is that this plan has very low degree in the metagraph, so it's
      hard for the random walk to find it. It's remarkable that it can even find a plan with six <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring
      districts. If you plug that distribution into the sampling tool above and look at the histograms, you'll see that
      the vast majority of plans have four <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats, with a small handful
      of plans with five. Very rarely will it even find a six-<span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-seat plan,
      which demonstrates the effectiveness of the restarting mechanism.
    </p>

    <h3>Electoral uncertainty</h3> 
    <p>
    	Before we move forward, we need an additional piece of machinery from probability theory.  Up until now, we've
    	treated elections as <em>deterministic</em>, meaning that a party will surely win a seat if at least half of the
    	squares in the corresponding district are of that color.  Now, we'll introduce a little bit of uncertainty.  To 
    	keep the math simple, we'll now say that the <em>probability</em> that a party wins a seat is equal to the 
    	<em>proportion of squares in the coresponding district of that color</em>.  In this new framework, we say that
    	a district with three <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> and four <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> squares
    	will be won by the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party with probability $\tfrac{4}{7}$ and the 
    	<span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party with probability $\tfrac{3}{7}$.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Now, instead of talking about how many seats we can get for the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party, 
    	we need to talk about how many <em>and</em> with what probability.  Below, you can adjust the arrangement
    	of the voters to play around with this concept.  The districting plan is fixed, and as you change the 
    	voters, you'll see the probability that the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins each district 
    	as well as <em>total probabilities</em> for the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party winning 
    	any particular number of seats.
    </p>

    <p>
    	From the perspective of the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party, these probabilities are incredibly
    	important.  Notice that if you make each district have four <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters and 
      three <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> voters, then there is still a reasonable probability of 
      the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party winning a majority of seats,
    	but if you have four districts with seven  <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> voters,  and 
      three with seven <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> voters, then the
    	 <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party can never win a majority of the seats.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Now, the key problem to consider is <em>supposing we want at least a certain number of the districts to be 
        won by the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party with a certain probability, how should we
        draw the districts?</em> We've introduced a new degree of freedom, called <em>seat fragility</em> which 
        quantifies how secure the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party feels about the outcome.  Using the example above, 
        we might feel better about drawing a plan where the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party is guaranteed to win
        four of the seven seats than one which leaves the door open for our rivals to win a majority, even if it does allow 
        the possibility of winning a larger majority sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quantity we're interested in examining is the <em>cumulative probability</em> of the 
       <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party winning <em>at least</em> some number of seats $k$. 
       In other words, we can take any districting plan and arrangement of voters and figure out 
       the probability of there being at least $k$ <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins in 
       our new randomized model.  As we just saw, the plan which maximizes this quantity is different for 
       different choices of $k$.  The safe plan, where four districts have all <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> 
       voters and three have all <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> voters is the best choice if we choose $k$ to be 
       four, but it's definitely not the right one if we want $k$ to be five.  
    </p>
    <p>
      This all seems well and good, but even once we pick $k$, we've made the problem of finding the best plan 
      much harder, at least by hand.  Before, we could kind of rely on a packing-and-cracking heurstic where we 
      try to make the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party win their districts by a bigger margin than the 
      <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party wins theirs, but that doesn't seem like quite enough when 
      we're working in this richer probabilistic model.  Fortunately for us, the MCMC algorithm from 
      before is fantastic at performing this search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the demo below to explore this concept. As before, you can arrange the voters on the left and use the buttons 
      in the middle to perform the MCMC search.  The algorithm is the same as before, where it performs a random walk and 
      occasionally restarts, keeping track of the best one it found so far.  The two charts on the right show the probabilities
      we're interested in.  The first one is the probability of the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party winning exactly 
      that number of seats, and the one on the bottom is the <em>cumulative probability</em> of the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> Party 
      winning <em>at least</em> that number of seats.
