   <h3>Exploration with MCMC: Finding extremes</h3>
    <p>
      As another indication of how well our random walks are exploring, let's see what happens if we take many short runs
      and look for extreme outcomes.  Once you pick your distribution and click to search, the algorithm will run 
      for 1,500 steps in short bursts of 150.  Every 150 steps, it restarts its walk from the most extreme plan 
      it has found so far, and at the end it displays the best one found overall.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea behind this is that plans which disproportionately favor one particular party tend to be near each other
      in the metagraph, so we should search for improvements near the best plan we've already seen. However, we don't
      want to get stuck in a neighborhood which has pretty good plans, but not the best, so we introduce some randomness
      to get us unstuck, in a way that is controlled by the restart frequency.
    </p>

    <p>
      You'll notice that this does really well, but not always perfectly. For example, if you make the top three rows
      all <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> and the bottom four all <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>,
      if you try a few times, the algorithm will probably find a plan that lets the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
      Party win six seats, but almost certainly not one with seven <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
      districts. This is for two reasons -- first, that there is only one plan which has seven <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring
      districts (seven vertical strips), and the second is that this plan has very low degree in the metagraph, so it's
      hard for the random walk to find it. It's remarkable that it can even find a plan with six <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-favoring
      districts. If you plug that distribution into the sampling tool above and look at the histograms, you'll see that
      the vast majority of plans have four <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats, with a small handful
      of plans with five. Very rarely will it even find a six-<span class="hearts">Hearts</span>-seat plan,
      which demonstrates the effectiveness of the restarting mechanism.
